/**
 * The parse<>() template function defines a basic mechanism for parsing data
 * objects in Fire. This function was added to clean up parsing with
 * LocalParsers in Fire since the code below is common to almost all local
 * parser types. Instead of copying the four line implementation below all over
 * the code base, client code now looks like the following
 * @code
 * auto data = parse<T>(filename);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Those concerned about the performance of calling parse<>() should know that
 * it performs very well because of C++11's move semantics and return value
 * optimizations provided by the compiler. It may perform slowly when used in
 * debug mode with gcc since these optimizations may be disabled.
 *
 * @return an instance of class T created from the default constructor.
