# Find the SUNDIALS library of hybrid CPU+GPU solvers.
#
# Usage:
#   find_package(SUNDIALS [REQUIRED] [QUIET] )
#
# The following variables will be set if the library is found:
#   SUNDIALS_FOUND          ... set to true if module(s) exist
#   SUNDIALS_LIBRARIES      ... list of SUNDIALS libraries (w/o the '-l')
#   SUNDIALS_LIBRARY_DIRS   ... the paths of the libraries (w/o the '-L')
#   SUNDIALS_INCLUDE_DIRS   ... the '-I' preprocessor flags (w/o the '-I')
#
# The following variables can be used to influence how the function searches 
# for SUNDIALS:
#   SUNDIALS_ROOT                ... if set, the libraries are exclusively searched
#                                 under this path

# Configure the basic set of libraries
set(SUNDIALS_LIBRARIES_LIST sundials_cvode sundials_nvecserial)

# If Spack is available and SUNDIALS_ROOT specified, see if Spack has an
# installation of Sundials hanging around.
if(NOT SUNDIALS_ROOT AND SPACK_ROOT)
  # Run the Spack search command and deposit the result directly into the
  # SUNDIALS_ROOT variable since it is empty in this branch.
